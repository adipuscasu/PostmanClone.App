## Purpose
Builds a WinForms application that can call APIs and display the results.
Technologies used:
* C#
* .NET 8
* WinForms
This solution uses several libraries:
* [Flurl](https://github.com/tmenier/Flurl) - for doing the HTTP calls
* [FluentValidation](https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation) - for implementing HTTP URL validation
* [FluentAssertions](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions) - for easier to understand unit tests

## Usage
TODO - research how to use the MSIX package
